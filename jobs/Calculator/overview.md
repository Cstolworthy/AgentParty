# Console-Based Symbolic Calculator

## Project Overview

Build a C# console application capable of evaluating mathematical expressions containing:

- Basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /)
- Variable symbols (single-character identifiers such as x, y, z)
- Multi-term symbolic expressions (2x - x + 3y)
- Implicit multiplication (2x = 2 * x)
- Algebraic simplification
- Parentheses
- Variable substitution (x=5)

## Goals
- REPL console calculator
- Parse expressions into an AST
- Simplify symbolic expressions
- Evaluate when variables have values
- Friendly errors

## Success Criteria
- Expressions with variables are simplified correctly
- Expressions with assignments evaluate correctly
- All tests pass under TDD
